# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-DIT181
The course is a part of the Software Engineering and Management program at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology.

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental building blocks in almost all software products. Knowledge of data abstraction, data structures, and algorithms is important in the construction, use, and maintenance of adaptable, reusable, and efficient program components.

The course gives knowledge and skills in the construction and use of data structures and algorithmic concepts, and gives an introduction to algorithm analysis and data abstraction.
